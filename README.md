### 👋 Hey, hi, hello.

#### _[Ask me anything &rarr;](https://github.com/dreger/dreger/discussions/new?category=ama)_

I'm K.Q. Dreger. By day I work at [Patriot](https://patriotsoftware.com/), where I get to empower our design, engineering, and product as the VP of Product. By night I write about products, people, and punctuation. And by nighter night I bake. 🍕, mostly.

Say hi: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dreger) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dreger).
